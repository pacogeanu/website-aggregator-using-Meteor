"# website-aggregator-using-Meteor" 

The purpose of the application is to allow users to share, discuss and rate pages they find on the internet.

The following features are implemented:
Users can register and login.
Users can post new websites if they are logged in. 
Users can up and down vote webpages.
Websites are listed with the most up voted site first. 
The listing page shows when the website was added and how many up and down votes it has.
Users can move to a detail page for a website (using routing). 
On the detail page, users can post comments about a webpage, and they are displayed below the description of the webpage.
Automatic information: the HTTP package for Meteor is used to pull in information about the posted web links automatically, so the user does not need to enter anything other than the URL.
Search function: allows the user to search within the listed sites for key words
Website recommender: websites are recommended to users based on things they have up voted and commented on.
